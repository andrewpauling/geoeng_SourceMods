Source code modifications for the model runs in "Geoengineering by optimally flooding the Arctic sea ice with seawater reduces future sea ice thinning" by Andrew G. Pauling and Cecilia M. Bitz, submitted to Geophysical Research Letters in July 2019

The directory 'icepack" contains the modified source code for the Icepack experiments run for the paper. Get the Icepack model here: https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack
Files beginning with "icepack_" should be copied into the columnphysics directory. Files beginning with "icedrv_" should be pasted into the configuration/driver directory.
